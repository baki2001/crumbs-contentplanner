2. **Set up admin roles** by configuring `ADMIN_IDS` in secrets.env  
3. **Start the bot** using `python bot.py`

## Example Workflow

1. Admin creates a template:

`/addtemplate Avalonian`  
text

```json
{
  "Tank": {"count": 2, "emoji": "üõ°Ô∏è"},
  "Healer": {"count": 4, "emoji": "‚ù§Ô∏è"},
  "DPS": {"count": 10, "unlimited": true},
  "Scout": {"count": 2, "emoji": "üëÅÔ∏è"}
}
```

2. User schedules an activity:  
text  
`/createactivity Avalonian`  
Enters: 2023-12-15 20:00 and Brecilien

3. Participants join:  
Click desired role button on the embed  
Unlimited DPS slots always available  
Limited roles show available slots (e.g., "Tank (1/2)")

4. View scheduled activities:  
Each activity shows:
- Time remaining  
- Participants by role  
- Available slots  
- Location

## Best Practices

**For Admins:**
- Use clear template names (e.g., "Avalonian-10man")
- Set reasonable slot limits
- Include emojis for visual clarity

**For Users:**
- Join activities early for limited roles
- Use `/leaveactivity` if you can't attend
- All times are in UTC

## Troubleshooting

- Commands not appearing? Try `/sync` (owner only)
- Button not working? The bot may have restarted - recreate the activity
- Timezone confusion? All times are displayed in UTC
- Pro Tip: Pin the activity message in your channel for easy access!
